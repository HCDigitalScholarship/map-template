They also work to channel resources and access to investment capital directly to small businesses by&nbsp;connecting entrepreneurs with&nbsp;donors and investors interested in their specific industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agora&#39;s work is influenced by their belief that &quot;we&nbsp;need social entrepreneurs actively working to address global issues, yet too many entrepreneurs, especially those working in low-income communities, are unable to reach their potential due to unequal access to<br />\r\nfinancing and support.&quot; The organization provides workshops and support systems&nbsp;to &quot;level the playing field&quot; for entrepreneurs who are building truly inclusive business models that can move whole communities forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://agora2030.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570901104938000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7mvGMWeanStS8Q15Pae8BxVDLxA\" href=\"https://agora2030.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://agora2030.org/</a>&nbsp;</p>",
