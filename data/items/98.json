The Center meets basic needs such as food and showers.&nbsp;Through a team of local professionals, they also help youth to access state-run services, including protection, asylum, accommodation, and education. Velos Youth Center&#39;s holistic support strategies combine physical health and safety with programs for education, empowerment, and community building. The center&#39;s goal is to support unaccompanied children and young people&nbsp;as they re-start their lives in a place. They help young people to safely and legally build a life in Athens or an alternative destination that is in their better interest.</p>",
