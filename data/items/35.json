  "description":"<p>Let&#39;s Circle Up seeks to build relationships, community, and leaders through experiential, participatory, and collaborative restorative justice (RJ) values and principles. Our workshops and other group dialogue experiences empower us to practice RJ in everyday life with the aim of restoring damaged relationships caused by past harm, to the extent possible, and ending future harm.<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s Circle Up was founded in 2007 by Charles Boyd and Phill Rosado while residents at Graterford (now Phoenix) State Correctional Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students, staff, faculty and alumni have participated alongside incarcerated LCU leaders facilitating workshops and special events since 2010. CPGC supports the material costs of the workshop and student volunteers&#39; transportation to Phoenix SCI. Haverford hosts and sponsors RJ workshops led by LCU volunteers on campus and in the Philadelphia area. The student club Rethink Incarceration has connected to foster activist collaboration. Janice Lion is the Haverford liaison and a member of the Let&rsquo;s Circle Up Steering Committee.</p>",
