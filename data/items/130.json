Free medical clinics are also available multiple times per week. The John Paul Hammond Drop-In Center provides participants with a safe place to find shelter from the street and become linked to social and medical services. As the longest-running service provided by PPP, the Syringe Service Program has been a major factor in reducing the number of new HIV infections in Philadelphia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ppponline.org\">https://ppponline.org</a></p>",
