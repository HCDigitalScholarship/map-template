  "description":"<p>The Philadelphia Orchard Project is a nonprofit organization that plants and supports community orchards in the city of Philadelphia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In partnership with communities, we envision urban ecosystems that create beautiful green spaces, connect neighbors, provide hands-on learning experiences, and grow fresh fruit for generations to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2007, POP has worked with community-based groups and volunteers to plan and plant orchards filled with useful and edible plants in neighborhoods&nbsp;across the city. POP provides orchard design assistance, plant materials, and training in orchard care. Community organizations own, maintain, and harvest the orchards, expanding community-based food production. Orchards are planted in formerly vacant lots, community gardens, schoolyards, and other urban spaces, almost exclusively in low-wealth neighborhoods where people experience limited access to fresh fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phillyorchards.org/\">https://www.phillyorchards.org/</a></p>",
