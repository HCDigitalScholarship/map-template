  "description":"<p>The PALM Center mission is to assist adults 50 years of age and older to maintain a healthy, satisfying quality of life by providing services and activities in a nurturing environment that enables them to function more independently in the community. The Center is an advocate of unmet needs of older adults and is a repository of information to assure them their rights, benefits and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students can volunteer at the Center in a variety of ways, including committing weekly to go and lead a class, or participating in a one time event where students and seniors work together on an activity like making a blanket or discussing current events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.palmseniors.org/\"><cite class=\"iUh30\">https://www.palmseniors.org/</cite></a></p>",
