  "description":"<p>The Sefrou Youth Center is for young people to study music, languages, theater, art, and more. It is open to youth who are still in school but who do not have the financial means for private lessons. The center requests only minimal fees for students to participate in the activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPGC will send one Haverford student to work in the youth center of Sefrou, Morocco. The intern will teach a language (either French or English), do office work, and engage the youth in various activities including sports, music, theater, and art, depending on skills of the intern.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the organization, this internship is only open to a male Haverford student. The intern will be living with the two female Bi-Co Cherry Buttons&#39; interns at the home of Amina Yabis, the founder of the Cherry Button&#39;s Women&#39;s Artist Co-op and Treasurer of the Sefrou Women&#39;s Empowerment Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/media/2018/12/20/youthcenter3_zukerman_morocco_2018.JPG\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 225px;\" /></p>",
