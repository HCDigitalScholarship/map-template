  "description":"<p>This isn&rsquo;t your typical science class. At FirstHand, an educational initiative at the University City Science Center, classroom lessons are brought to life through engaging projects and real-life lab environments. By adding the Arts to the STEM disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, FirstHand provides a gateway to creative, design-based applications of science and technology. Students learn what it means to experiment and determine things firsthand alongside scientists and educators. As a result, they gain personal experiences that allow them to fully grasp the power of STEM subjects and get excited about how to apply the subjects in their own lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://firsthandphilly.org/\">https://firsthandphilly.org/</a></p>",
