  "description":"<p>All of the Special Olympics&#39; programs are completely free to registered athletes. They offer year-round sports training and competition through school-based programming and at community training sites throughout Philadelphia. Their school-based programming focuses on students in elementary, middle and high schools and our community program works with individuals with intellectual disabilities over 8 years of age. For those individuals who are between the ages of 2 and 7 with an intellectual disability, they have their Young Athletes program that helps these individuals build up their sports skills so they can become the next generation of athletes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to providing sports training and competition, they are making strides in areas like healthcare, leadership and community-building, right here in Philadelphia. Many Haverford College athletic teams volunteer during competition days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sopaphilly.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552660932752000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHggGo7TP21L3IL7LMIuITAES4WXQ\" href=\"https://www.sopaphilly.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sopaphilly.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Fall 2018 Villanova Special Olympics\" src=\"/media/media/2019/03/14/special-olympics.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 173px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fall 2018 Villanova Special Olympics </em></p>",
