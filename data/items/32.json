They envision a nation where all workers enjoy the rights to:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Living wages, health care, and pensions that allow workers to raise families and retire with dignity<br />\r\n-Safe working conditions, free from discrimination<br />\r\n-Organize and bargain collectively to improve wages, benefits, and conditions without harassment, intimidation, or retaliation<br />\r\n-Equal protection under labor law - regardless of immigration status - and an end to the practice of pitting immigrant and U.S.-born workers against one another<br />\r\n-Fair and just participation in a global economy that promotes the welfare of both domestic and foreign workers</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.iwj.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541603722689000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkPhvr9dBS3X1rN_aIYEZWBlH2ug\" href=\"http://www.iwj.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iwj.org</a></p>",
