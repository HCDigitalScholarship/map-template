Experiences here are rigorous emotionally, physically, and intellectually, and students leave High Rocks with ample knowledge about West Virginia, the challenges facing young women in these communities, and ideas around ethical social change and effective citizenship. Interns will become part of a growing network of women from all over the country.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">High Rocks partners with Haverford for several service learning programs.
