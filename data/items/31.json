  "description":"<p>In its neighborhood of South Ardmore, Bethel AME Church is one of three churches in a close-knit, traditionally African-American community. The building, as it stands today, is a little more than 40 years old, the original building having burned to a shell in 1973. The congregation rebuilt, with the change that the front of the church was shifted from Walnut Avenue to Sheldon Lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haverford students have volunteered at Bethel in a variety of ways, most often helping in their community garden, as seen below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/media/2018/09/18/bethelame1.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bethel also has a need for administrative help, and they are initiating a new internship:</p>\r\n\r\n<div><em><font size=\"2\"><font size=\"2\"><font size=\"2\"><font size=\"2\"><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font color=\"black\"><font size=\"2\"><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font color=\"black\">Assistance is needed with community outreach, community development and engagement - additionally helping the organization and its subsidiaries promoting their message, work, events and the like. </font></font></font></font></font></font>Interns will be expected to meet weekly with the head of the organization, ensure that social media handles are as &quot;current&#39; as possible, assist in staffing of events.
