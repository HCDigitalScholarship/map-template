  "description":"<p>The Woody Guthrie Archive was originally processed by Musicologist and Archivist Jorge&rsquo; Arevalo Mateus, Phd, and is the largest collection of Woody Guthrie primary resource materials in the world. The archives was transferred to Tulsa from Mount Kisco, New York, with the help of Archivist Tiffany Colannino. Colannino (who managed and headed the archives while they resided in New York) was consulted for the design of the research room, the vault, and she also ensured safe travel for the artifacts and manuscripts to their new home. There are internship opportunities available here for Haverford students interested in arts &amp; culture and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://woodyguthriecenter.org/archives/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1545415826484000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCkQ4okyRrlI3oJqe3dLkklMgzGQ\" href=\"http://woodyguthriecenter.org/archives/\" target=\"_blank\">http://woodyguthriecenter.org/<wbr />archives/</a></p>",
