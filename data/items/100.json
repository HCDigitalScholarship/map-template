  "description":"<p>Parkway NW is a public high school with the mission to develop successful young adults who are leaders for peace and social justice. They&#39;ve created a radical, empowering learning environment that combines&nbsp;a small, tight-knit school community with&nbsp;the extensive learning opportunities of a much larger school. Founded as a &quot;school without walls,&quot; Parkway both challenges and supports its students and their families&#39; work for social justice through continued engagement&nbsp;with local&nbsp;communities. The Parkway curriculum focuses on critical thinking, problem-solving, cooperative learning, and research, to &quot;prepare students to face a complex world with the skills necessary to institute positive change locally and globally.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://parkwaynw.philasd.org/\">https://parkwaynw.philasd.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/media/2019/10/16/img_20190522_152304-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 188px;\" /></p>",
