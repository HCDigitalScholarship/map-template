Work spans child health, early learning, education, and family stability. An example of work that&#39;s been done in partnership with Haverford College is a project in which a group of students worked with PCCY to make progress on the Dream Care campaign to fight for health insurance for PA children who are undocumented and do not have insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pccy.org/\">https://www.pccy.org/</a></p>",
