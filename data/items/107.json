The Petey Greene Program inspires its&nbsp;alumni to become advocates and to take on leadership roles that will re-imagine the criminal justice system. Petey Grene envisions a world in which all incarcerated people have access to high-quality academic programs. Haverford students apply to&nbsp;volunteer as tutors at prisons in the Philadelphia area through Petey Greene&#39;s program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.peteygreene.org/\">https://www.peteygreene.org/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
