  "description":"<p>In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre&#39;s (HOBT) mission is to bring people together for the common good through the power of puppet and mask performance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHOBT uses water, flour, newspaper, paint, and unlimited imagination to tell stories that explore the struggles and celebrations of human existence. Drawing inspiration from the world&#39;s traditions of puppet and mask theatre and its lively roots in transformative ritual and street theatre, HOBT creates vital, poetic theater for all ages and backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hobt.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541603717366000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoefPRD_r173l91GMAi8wvhxX9xA\" href=\"https://hobt.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://hobt.org/</a></p>",
