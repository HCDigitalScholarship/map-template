  "description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">At Facing History and Ourselves, we believe the bigotry and hate that we witness today are the legacy of brutal injustices of the past. Facing our collective history and how it informs our attitudes and behaviors allows us to choose a world of equity and justice. Facing History&rsquo;s resources address racism, antisemitism, and prejudice at pivotal moments in history; we help students connect choices made in the past to those they will confront in their own lives. Through our partnership with educators around the world, Facing History and Ourselves reaches millions of students in thousands of classrooms every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By integrating the study of history, literature, and human behavior with ethical decision making and innovative teaching strategies,&nbsp;our program enables secondary school teachers to promote students&rsquo; historical understanding, critical thinking, and social-emotional learning. As students explore the complexities of history and make connections to current events, they reflect on the choices they confront today and consider how they can make a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facinghistory.org/\">https://www.facinghistory.org/</a></p>",
