  "description":"<div>Asian Arts Initiative advances racial equity and understanding, activates artists, youth, and their communities through creative practice and dialogue grounded in the diverse Asian American experience. The organization was founded in 1993 as a response to community concerns about growing racial tension between African American and Asian American communities and grew out of a program at the Painted Bride Art Center, which was Philadelphia&rsquo;s first-ever Asian American Arts Festival: Live Traditions/Contemporary Issues. Today, our work remains rooted in this initial concern and programming is centered around building community and gaining greater cross-cultural understanding through the arts.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Students interested in a fellowship with AAI should apply through the Asian Arts Initiative Summer Fellowship application on <a href=\"http://cpgc-apply.haverford.edu\" target=\"_blank\">cpgc-apply.haverford.edu</a>. The Asian Arts Initiative fellow will engage in an excellent opportunity to experience various aspects of public arts programming, development and marketing while working for a well-known community based nonprofit organization. They will work directly with Programming, Development and Communications department, and additional staff.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"http://asianartsinitiative.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://asianartsinitiative.<wbr />org/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>This is part of the<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OfDCZariSv_iSX2cfcG5dbq-7_poHzwyPbeGM_H9y78/edit#heading=h.m9gdb6sgs64i\"> <b>Philadelphia Justice and Equity Fellowship:</b></a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",
