  "description":"<p>Let&#39;s Circle Up (LCU) is a grassroots restorative justice (RJ) project led and organized by men incarcerated at Phoenix State Correctional Institution in Graterford, Pennsylvania. LCU&nbsp;seeks to build relationships, community, and leaders through experiential, participatory, and collaborative RJ values and principles. Let&#39;s Circle Up&#39;s&nbsp;workshops and group dialogue experiences empower participants and leaders&nbsp;to practice RJ in everyday life with the aim of restoring damaged relationships caused by past harm &mdash; to the extent possible &mdash;&nbsp;and ending future harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haverford&#39;s CPGC&nbsp;is a primary partner for LCU,&nbsp;supporting outside volunteer engagement, workshops, and relationship-building. Professor&nbsp;Kristin Lindgren of the Writing Center provides writing workshops to leaders of the program inside Phoenix SCI and has developed exhibits and programs in the Bi-Co dedicated to amplifying LCU&#39;s work. LCU offers monthly community workshops for allied groups and has hosted Haverford&#39;s prison abolition group Rethink Incarceration, a group of faculty learning about engaged pedagogy, and CPGC staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More on Haverford&#39;s Connections to Let&#39;s Circle Up:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/lets-circle-introductory-restorative-justice-workshop\">https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/lets-circle-introductory-restorative-justice-workshop</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/shared-grounds-episode-2-janice-lion\">https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/shared-grounds-episode-2-janice-lion</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/amanda-grolig-19\">https://www.haverford.edu/peace-and-global-citizenship/news/amanda-grolig-19</a></p>",
