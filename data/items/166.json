  "description":"<p>The Mainline Greenway/Bike Delaware County is project-based on Lancaster Ave, Haverford. This project aims to create a bike line for all of the residents that use their bicycle as their primary mode of transportation, the Mainline Greenway. The general goal of the project is to get Haverford&#39;s residents involved in the infrastructure of their own town. It aims to re-imagine the street infrastructure of Haverford Township as well as the Delaware and Montgomery County to accommodate healthier ways of transportation.&nbsp;</p>",
