  "description":"<p>The Green Market Santa Cruz (GMSC) in Trinidad formed itself as a social enterprise focusing on the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goal #12: changing patterns of consumption and production. Three overarching objectives inform GMSC&#39;s mission and modus operandi: 1) linking small farmers and garden growers directly to consumers; 2) fostering land-based entrepreneurship by transforming and adding value to local agricultural products; 3) providing a modern day village green to encourage conviviality and gentle public education about the interconnectedness of all of Nature&#39;s components and the need for their protection and conservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since summer 2018, GMSC hosts up to 2 CPGC summer fellows each year. Jon Wilson&#39;s Economic Botany spring break field study to Trinidad also visits GMSC to learn about the work they do in community-based sustainable development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/media/2018/12/20/138-1.JPG\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.greenmarketsantacruz.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1545428781557000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEb3cbYRhzm04ypWtN2jCqCFCPrug\" href=\"http://www.greenmarketsantacruz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.<wbr />greenmarketsantacruz.com/</a></p>",
