  "description":"<p>College Together is an entirely new college experience where youth earn an accelerated college degree and learn professional skills in a supportive job placement at the same time. Without having to choose between working on learning, they finish a degree in as little as a year and earn an income instead of taking on debt- all while in a learning community with daily mentorship and holistic support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.collegetogether.org/\">https://www.collegetogether.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This organization is part of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OfDCZariSv_iSX2cfcG5dbq-7_poHzwyPbeGM_H9y78/edit#heading=h.m9gdb6sgs64i\"><b>Philadelphia Justice and Equity Fellowship&nbsp;</b></a></p>",
